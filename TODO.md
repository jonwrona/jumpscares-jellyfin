# TODO

Parking lot for ideas to implement when I have time.

-   check existing movies that are missing jump scare data, and query the notscare API for those scares
-   allow the user to toggle on jumpscare markers in the watching UI somehow, probably similar to selecting subtitles? default markers to off?
